# Face-mask-detection
Face mask detection using keras and openCV

We have used face mask detection dataset from kaggle which consists of pictures of people with masks and without masks. 
Firstly we have made a CNN model to predict the masks on the faces. 
We have used MobileNet to carry out the neural network
To detect the masks we firstly require to detect the faces.
To do so we have used a pretrained DNN network ReadNet which comes with openCV
